## About Me  
After earning my **Bachelor of Commerce in Information Technology Management** at Toronto Metropolitan University, I embarked on a unique journey—traveling, teaching English in Japan and Thailand, and honing my leadership skills as a chef and baker. Along the way, I developed a strong foundation in adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork.  

During a career break as a full-time parent, I rediscovered my interest for technology and data, leading me to complete a **9-week (+400hrs) Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack**. Through hands-on projects, I gained experience solving real-world problems by analyzing complex datasets, building predictive models, creating dynamic dashboards, and uncovering actionable insights to drive decision-making.
