## About Me  
After earning my **Bachelor of Commerce in Information Technology Management** at Toronto Metropolitan University, I embarked on a unique journeyâ€”traveling, teaching English in Japan and Thailand, and honing my leadership skills as a chef and baker. Along the way, I developed a strong foundation in adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork.  

During a career break as a full-time parent, I rediscovered my passion for technology and data. That realization inspired me to complete a **9-week Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack**, where I gained hands-on experience in:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn)  
- **SQL** (querying, database management)  
- **Tableau** (data visualization, dashboards)  
- **Machine Learning** (supervised/unsupervised models, hyperparameter tuning)
