# Hi, I'm Jonathan Tsui  
**Data Analyst | From Toronto, Canada | Based in Madrid**  

Welcome to my GitHub! I help SaaS and data-driven teams turn technical user, product, and marketing data into decision-ready insights that drive growth, retention, and efficiency. By leveraging Python, SQL, Excel, and BI tools, I deliver reports with recommendations that define the right metrics, improve decision-making, and create measurable business value.

## About Me  

My career path has been unconventional, spanning teaching, culinary leadership, and podcasting across Canada, Japan, Thailand, and now Madrid. At every stage, data, efficiency, and storytelling have been my constants. These experiences shaped my adaptability and ability to communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

At Tradler, I broke into analytics and quickly grew by applying the same grit and discipline I honed as a chef. I thrive in fast-moving, quick-pivoting environments where I can keep learning, deliver value, and get the job done.

Focus areas

Product analytics: KPIs, OKRs, cohort analysis, lifecycle, funnels, conversion, retention/churn

### Fun Fact  
I trained for and completed my first marathon (42.2 km in 3:54) within a year of starting running and while caring for my young son—proof that I thrive under pressure and love tackling challenges!
